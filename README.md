# Nullable Analyzer

The Nullable Analyzer is a Roslyn-based diagnostic analyzer for C# that helps developers identify unnecessary uses of the nullable reference types feature introduced in C# 8.0. Specifically, it targets scenarios where nullable annotations (`?`) or the null-forgiving operator (`!`) are used unnecessarily, indicating potential misunderstandings or overuse of these features.

## Features

- **Unnecessary Nullable Annotation Detection**: Identifies when nullable annotations are applied to reference types in contexts where nullability is already guaranteed or not applicable.
- **Redundant Null-Forgiving Operator Detection**: Flags uses of the null-forgiving operator that are unnecessary, based on the flow analysis of the code.
- **Flow State Analysis**: Utilizes Roslyn's semantic model to perform flow state analysis, determining whether variables are definitely assigned and whether they can be null in the given context.

## Requirements

- .NET SDK (version supporting C# 8.0 or higher)
- Visual Studio 2019 or newer (for development and testing of the analyzer)

## Installation

To use the Nullable Analyzer in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Package Reference**: Add a reference to the Nullable Analyzer package in your project file. (Note: This assumes the analyzer is packaged and available as a NuGet package. Adjust instructions as necessary based on the distribution method.)
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="NullableAnalyzer" Version="1.0.0" PrivateAssets="all"/>
</ItemGroup>


2. **Restore Packages**: Ensure that your NuGet packages are restored, either through Visual Studio's automatic package restore or by running `dotnet restore` in your project directory.

3. **Build Your Project**: The analyzer will automatically run on build, identifying any issues in your code.

## Usage

Once installed, the Nullable Analyzer runs automatically during the build process of your project. Detected issues will appear in the Visual Studio Error List window, as well as in the output of the `dotnet build` command.

To address a reported issue, review the diagnostic message provided by the analyzer and adjust your code accordingly. The goal is to remove unnecessary nullable annotations and null-forgiving operators, making your use of C#'s nullable reference types feature more precise and meaningful.

## Configuration

The analyzer does not require any special configuration. However, you can configure its behavior using `.editorconfig` if specific customizations are needed for your project.
